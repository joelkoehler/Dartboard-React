Ideas:
//zoom/animation from landing to mapview
- reset/center location
- choose a location on the map as your location
- google places API to find points of interest nearby
- landing page additions, explaining functionality
    OR
- guided flow on initial mapview load (cookies) - centered white slider div? black arrow overlay?
- tap a pin to send via SMS, email, QR code to open maps on phone
- history tab?
- quick copy for coordinates
- "remove oceans" option


Known bugs:
- [UI...minor] options panel arrow is disconnected 
- [UI...minor] gear button doesn't "bob" onclick for mobile
- [UI...minor] "pin" jumps when info pressed
- [medium] out-of-bounds return values coming from locGenerator...which causes the pin card to not update (which is good i guess)
- OPTIONS FREAK TF OUT (has to do with tooltip boundary i think)


MVP features todo:
- UI finishes
- (optional) info button


TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- React
- QR code generation (qrcode.react) 
- Google Maps API (google-map-react)
- Google Street View
- User location


DESCRIPTION:
Dartboard is a web app built in React, intended to spark adventure and inspire movement.
When the user "throws a dart" at the map, Darboard randomly drops a pin within a set distance 
of their current location. A QR code is generated to begin navigation to the pin when scanned with a mobile device,
or links to Google Maps and Street View are available if already on mobile (or simply to 
check the spot out in more detail).

Looking for a new skate spot or photography challenge? Have the urge to go on a run or take a spontaneous road trip? 
Dartboard has you covered.
